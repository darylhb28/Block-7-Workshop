// 2. Assign the first variable using an arithamtic operator to equal 10.
// 3. Assign the second variable using an arithamtic operator to equal 40.
// 4. Assign the third variable using an arithmatic operator to equal 39.
// 5. Concatenate the string and the variables in a pop-up dialog box.

// Step 1 - creating a string 
const str = "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination: "

// Step 2 - assigning first variable using +
const num1 = 4 + 6

// Step 3 - assigning second variable using *
const num2 = 10 * 4

// Step 4 - assigning third variable using -
const num3 = 40 - 1

// Step 5 - concatenating string and varibale to display message with code, using template literals
alert(`${str} ${num1} - ${num2} - ${num3}`)
